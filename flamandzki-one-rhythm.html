    <h1>Flamandzki Artur – One Rhythm, Many Numbers</h1>

      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>
      Since childhood, I’ve felt that mathematics wasn’t just a school subject — it was a space to explore. I never studied it “for grades”; I looked for problems that fascinated me, often far beyond the standard curriculum. 
      In primary school, with my father’s help, I was solving matrices and polynomials while my classmates were just discovering linear functions. By the time I finished middle school, I understood limits, derivatives, and complex numbers. In trigonometry, I didn’t memorize formulas — I derived them myself.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      But life doesn’t always favor study. In high school, I collided with reality, and my final exams became more a matter of survival than ambition. I left mathematics behind for a while — formally, at least. But the intuition stayed. 
      I built custom calculators capable of handling hundreds of thousands of digits, explored the structure of large numbers, wrote algorithms in Excel, Bascom, and C++, and pushed the limits of computation.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      I enrolled at Lodz University of Technology, where I was granted an Individual Course of Study. But personal difficulties forced me to leave. Years later, I returned to academia at the University of Social Sciences, earned my engineering and master’s degrees, and ran a company designing electronics and writing software — from concept to completion.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      At some point, I abandoned the pursuit of huge numbers as a dead end. Still, one idea stayed with me: if I could algorithmically solve the problem of counting numbers with a fixed number of divisors — maybe I could search for the largest prime numbers. And so began a process that matured in me for years.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      In 2022, I discovered the structure of prime numbers — not in theory, but in practice. I tried to share it with the academic world, but quickly hit a wall. Formalism was never my strength. I solved problems — I didn’t build proofs. That long effort, beginning in 2022, eventually led me to resolve the Riemann Hypothesis — not through complex analysis, but through structure. A structure that, perhaps, was always inside me.

      <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
      <p>
      What drives me is the desire to solve problems — but only the ones that inspire me. It's not just about the result — that often comes as a byproduct. What truly moves me forward is the quality and simplicity of the method.
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The way I reach a solution must have logic, structure, rhythm — it must be primal in its simplicity. That simplicity is my fuel. When a solution emerges as the natural consequence of a well-understood problem, I know I'm in the right place.

      <h2>What I Propose</h2>
      <p>
      At this stage, I prefer not to reveal too much.  
      However, I can assure you — it's worth checking back from time to time.

      <h2>Where It Leads</h2>
      <p style="margin-top: 2em; font-style: italic; color: #aaa;">
      The name of this site speaks for itself.  
      Be open to rhythm, curious about structure, and attuned to resonance.  
      Everything will reveal itself — in its own time.
      The rhythm is one, the numbers are many.

        A visual echo of internal structure — not calculated, but emergent.  
        The field lives on rhythm alone.
