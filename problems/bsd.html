      <h2>📚 The Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture is a central problem in number theory concerning elliptic curves and their associated L-functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        It predicts a deep relationship between the number of rational solutions on an elliptic curve and the behavior of its L-function at s = 1. Specifically, the conjecture asserts that the rank of the group of rational points on the curve equals the order of the zero of the L-function at that point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Understanding this connection is key to revealing the arithmetic properties of elliptic curves, with implications in cryptography, algebraic geometry, and the theory of modular forms.

      <h2>🔍 Preview</h2>
      <p>
        The approach to this problem is guided entirely by rhythm and internal resonance.
        There is no need for analytic continuation or height estimates of elliptic curves — the structure emerges on its own, anchored in predictable sequences that reflect balance rather than value.
        What reveals itself is not a formula, but a consequence of resonance.
