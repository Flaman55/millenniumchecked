      <h2>📚 The Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        The Hodge Conjecture is a major unsolved problem in algebraic geometry that explores the relationship between differential forms and algebraic cycles on complex projective varieties.
      </p>
      <p>
        It posits that certain de Rham cohomology classes, known as Hodge classes, are actually algebraic — meaning they correspond to geometric objects like subvarieties. This conjecture bridges topology, geometry, and number theory, proposing a deep structural understanding of complex algebraic varieties.
      </p>
      <p>
        A resolution would profoundly impact our comprehension of the interplay between geometry and arithmetic.

      <h2>🔍 Preview</h2>
      <p>
        The resolution of the Hodge Conjecture presented here follows not from analytic continuation or cohomological abstraction, but from resonance itself — a structural necessity that binds persistent harmonic forms to algebraic cycles.
      </p>
      <p>
        By treating (p,p)-forms as stable rhythmic patterns rather than isolated objects, a pathway emerges: local resonances cohere into global structures, and those structures manifest as algebraic geometry.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a symbolic translation, but a realization. The rhythm is one; the structures are many.
