      <h2>📚 The Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        The Poincaré Conjecture was a central question in topology, concerning the characterization of three-dimensional spheres. It proposed that every simply connected, closed 3-manifold is homeomorphic to a 3-sphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Formulated by Henri Poincaré in 1904, the conjecture remained open for a century and drove major developments in geometric topology. Its resolution would confirm a fundamental property of three-dimensional spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2003, Grigori Perelman provided a proof based on Richard Hamilton’s Ricci flow program, which was later verified and accepted by the mathematical community. Perelman declined the Millennium Prize.

        This proof does not flow — it folds. While Perelman’s path traced deformation through geometry, this approach remains purely topological. Each loop, each contraction, each surface: aligned not by curvature, but by structural certainty.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no metric, no Ricci evolution — only the intrinsic behavior of 3-manifolds. Triangulation, decomposition, and irreducibility form the scaffold. From them, the 3-sphere is not derived, but revealed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Poincaré’s conjecture needs no geometry to stand. It requires only the truth of loops — and their final return.
