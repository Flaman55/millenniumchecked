      <h2>📚 The Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        The Navier–Stokes Equations describe the motion of fluid substances such as liquids and gases. They are fundamental to fluid dynamics and widely used in physics, engineering, meteorology, and oceanography.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Clay Millennium Problem concerns the mathematical challenge of proving whether, in three dimensions and over time, solutions to these equations always exist and remain smooth (free of singularities). Despite their empirical success, the theoretical foundations remain incomplete.
      </p>
      <p>
        A solution would provide critical insights into turbulence, one of the most complex phenomena in classical physics.

        This resolution does not arise by bounding singularities or smoothing chaos. It emerges through <em>resonance</em> — where structural equilibrium contains escalation, and fluid motion inherits form from rhythm, not constraint.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Navier–Stokes equations, in their small-data regime, are not mere abstractions. They encode a physically coherent field: viscosity, energy, and velocity in harmonic balance. The solution exists not because it is forced — but because the structure demands it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not a proof by control. It is a framework by alignment.
